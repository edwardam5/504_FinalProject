## Project Description 
The purpose of this study is to predict whether an individual is suffering from diabetes within the United States. For this study, it was hypothesized that at least one of the four classification techniques of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression will result in a model that predicts an individual’s health status of having diabetes or not. More specifically, a secondary hypothesis is that the best predictor will be the Naive Bayes, based on the accuracy being greater than seventy-five percent. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The predictor variables observed in this study include: the number of adults within a household, general health, physical health, mental health, height, weight, sex, smoker, asthmatic, orange vegetable intake, geen vegetable intake, fruit intake, fruit juice intake. Additionally, health insurance, blood pressure medication, heart disease, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure was studied. The study determined that the best model was logistic regression, which had an accuracy of 89%. Further research regarding the precision and sensitivity of the model could be evaluated using additional predictors such as genetic history, presence of ketones in urine, or blurred vision.
